I am Cj -  This is a simply, yet ellegant and functional Restful API project I created, using laravel framework.

This is an API for a flight system that allows to book reservations. The idea is simple, and the code straight forward. 

With 21 endpoints, you can change and consume the data however you want. That is the point of this project, as the same concept can be used in other projects for simple clean API consumption.
Just to reiterate I don't intend to build a whole product here. It's just an implementation.

The idea is - we have various RESTFUL Endpoints that handle the creation, updating, storing, partially storing and deletion of data.
These various types of data are regarding Bookings, Flights, and Reservations - but like said, the same idea can be applied.


Here is a list of things I used to develop this API:
`
- Migrations <small><i>`database/migrations/*`</i></small>
- Database Seeding / Factories <small><i>`database/factories/*`</i></small></li>
- Tinker
- Resources/Collections <small><i>`app/Http/Resources/*`</i></small>
- Controllers <small><i>`app/Http/Controllers/*`</i></small>
- Request Validation <small><i>`app/Http/Requests/*`</i></small>
- Dependency Injection
- Resource Routing <small>`routes/api.php`</small>
- Full Unit Test Coverage <small><i>`tests/Feature/*`</i></small>
- Eloquent ORM / Models <small><i>`app/Model/*`</i></small>
- Events/Listeners

`factory(App\User::class)->create()` will result in New User, New Booking, New Reservation and a new Flight (Event/Listener `app/Events/UserCreated.php` triggers the additional factory creations) The trigger of the event happens in User Factory (`database/factories/UserFactory` `->afterCreating()` event.

#### Get it running

You will need a new database, and to run a few commands in the terminal.

- Create a database and update file .env with this new database informaiton.
- copy `.env.example` into `.env` and update DATABASE CONSTANTS with the database info you created.

Commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ajaxboy/flight-booking-api.git  api
    $ cd api
    $ composer install
    $ php artisan migrate
    $ php artisan db:seed
    $ php artisan key:generate
    $ php artisan serve

This will populate the database with random testing data. When you are done you should have 50 flights, 50 bookings, 50 reservations and 50 users in the database.

This will also run the app on port 8000, hence you should be able to run it by going to:  http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or whatever domain you use to host the project)

When you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000, the front facing page will show you the 'GET' methods only, additional methods will only
be able to be tested by making request with an API program such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or through API consumption.

#### Unit Testing

For `tests` the same database settings will be used as per your `.env` file;  you can change that by
creating a brand new database and updating file `phpunit.xml`

 phpunit.xml
    `<env name="DB_DATABASE" value="laravel" />`

 Run tests:
    `$ vendor/bin/phpunit`

If you do run the tests in the same database; the database will be whipped once the tests are completed.
To restore data run this:

    $ php artisan db:seed


Here is a list of ENDPOINTS (if you uploaded to a domain, just replace 127.0.0.1 for that domain)

### EndPoints

The endpoints are not meant to be tested on regular browsers (only the 'GET' methods will work)
The reason being that  API Endpoints are meant for program consumption.
You may need a special app like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
